# Set the phase offset of the system's vsync event relative to the hardware
# vsync. The system's vsync event drives Choreographer and SurfaceFlinger's
# rendering. This value is the number of nanoseconds after the hardware vsync
# that the system vsync event will occur.
#
# This phase offset allows adjustment of the minimum latency from application
# wake-up (by Choregographer) time to the time at which the resulting window
# image is displayed.  This value may be either positive (after the HW vsync)
# or negative (before the HW vsync).  Setting it to 0 will result in a
# minimum latency of two vsync periods because the app and SurfaceFlinger
# will run just after the HW vsync.  Setting it to a positive number will
# result in the minimum latency being:
#
#     (2 * VSYNC_PERIOD - (vsyncPhaseOffsetNs % VSYNC_PERIOD))
#
# Note that reducing this latency makes it more likely for the applications
# to not have their window content image ready in time.  When this happens
# the latency will end up being an additional vsync period, and animations
# will hiccup.  Therefore, this latency should be tuned somewhat
# conservatively (or at least with awareness of the trade-off being made).
